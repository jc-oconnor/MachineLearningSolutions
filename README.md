# MachineLearningSolutions
my solutions used in an online machine learning course

These solutions are from the Andrew Ng Machine learning course from Stanford University/CourseEra
The uploaded solutions are my own and not officailly from the course. If you are a student of the course please stick to the code of conduct and do not use my solutions to pass the course. 

This repository contains seven branches one for each assignment in the course. I have only uploaded the files that I had to edit
